# Instructions for Adding Your Robot Image

## Step 1: Save Your Robot Image
1. Save the robot image you uploaded to: `/app/frontend/public/images/robot.png`
2. Make sure the filename is exactly `robot.png`

## Step 2: Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG 
- WebP
- SVG

## Current Implementation
- The robot component will look for `/images/robot.png`
- If not found, it will fallback to a placeholder image
- The image will have green theme styling and hover animations

## File Path Structure
```
/app/frontend/public/
  └── images/
      └── robot.png  <-- Place your robot image here
```

The image will be accessible at: `http://localhost:3000/images/robot.png`
